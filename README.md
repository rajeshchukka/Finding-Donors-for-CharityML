# Project 1 : Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
Description

This is the 1st project for the Data Scientist Nanodegree. In this project, I used sklearn and supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help a fictitious charity organization identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

Here, I first investigate the factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made. Then, I use a training and predicting pipeline to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency/speed of three supervised machine learning algorithms (GaussianNB, SVC, Adaboost). I then proceed to fine tune the parameters of the algorithm that provides the highest donation yield (while reducing mailing efforts/costs). Finally, I also explore the impact of reducing number of features in data.

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

Python

NumPy

pandas

scikit-learn (v0.17)

Matplotlib

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.
